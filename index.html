											 Drivers Drowsiness Detection</h3>
											<div  class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
											<div><p> Made Driver drowsiness detection prototype using Haar Cascade Classifier, DLib Library, Facial Landmarks, and CNN with Python libraries. The tested prototype revealed limitations, and future plans focus on improving commercial viability. The dynamic system proposes continuous monitoring of driver drowsiness, adjusting vehicle speed, and triggering assistance features. Expanding capabilities to high-end real-time models, incorporating night vision, hydraulic brakes, and image enhancement algorithms, enhances overall vehicle safety. The system, beyond drowsiness detection, offers diverse applications like anti-distraction measures in online education and assessing employee attention span, showcasing its potential in various real-world scenarios.</p></div>

												Search Engine</h3>
											   <div  class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></div>
											<p>  <div>Used Java to develop a threaded search engine that tracked user searches, allows users to crawl web pages, and search an inverted index built from crawled web pages.</div>Processes all text files in a directory and its subdirectories, cleans and parses the text into word stems, and builds an in-memory inverted index to store the mapping from word stems to the documents and position within those documents where those word stems were found.

													</br>Supports exact search and partial search. In addition, application can track the total number of words found in each text file, parse and stem a query file, generate a sorted list of search results from the inverted index, and supports writing those results to a JSON file.
												
													</br>	Supports thread-safe inverted index, and uses a work queue to build and search the inverted index using multiple threads.
												
													</br>	Supports web crawling and acquiring html
												
													</br>			Supports User Tracking and stores user history
